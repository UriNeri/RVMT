## Description:   
Code, scripts, some logs and general misc. from to the RNA viruses in MetaTranscriptome discovery project (a.k.a RVMT), openly shared near the time of submission.

Disclaimer  
---------------------------
This repos consolidates scripts, code and various snippets used throughout the RVMT project. Many of these are custom, and the code is provided mostly for the purposes of disclosure rather than as a product. The scripts are heavily environment-dependent and are not likely to be able to work on other platforms without extensive modification.  
While we make no promise regarding the portability of this ensemble, should you want to try and make use of these, please do, they are FOSS after all, and feel free to let us know, we'll be happy to try and help out.


Presently, for more information, please see the projects' Zenodo deposit at: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.6091357. biorxiv preprint link and DOI will be provided shortly.
