## Description:   
Code, scripts, some logs and general misc. from to the RNA viruses in MetaTranscriptome discovery project (a.k.a RVMT), openly shared near the time of submission.    

Note! The scripts: [get_polyproteins.ipynb](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/rvmt-jgi/src/master/scripts/get_polyproteins.ipynb) and [get_clan_membership.ipynb](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/rvmt-jgi/src/master/scripts/get_clan_membership.ipynb) Mentioned in the paper, are availble over in a companion [bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/rvmt-jgi/src/master/)(due to some bureaucracy, we couldn't have those scripts on GitHub, but hopefully whoever is interested in them could find them useful just the same over in the bitbucket repo).  


Disclaimer  
---------------------------
This repos consolidates scripts, code and various snippets used throughout the RVMT project. Many of these are custom, and the code is provided mostly for the purposes of disclosure rather than as a product. The scripts are heavily environment-dependent and are not likely to be able to work on other platforms without extensive modification.  
While we make no promise regarding the portability of this ensemble, should you want to try and make use of these, please do, they are FOSS after all, and feel free to let us know, we'll be happy to try and help out.
